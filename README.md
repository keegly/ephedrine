Yet another DMG/CGB Gameboy emulator project.

Controls for now are the arrow keys, z, x, enter, and right shift for select. Rebinding and controller support I would like to add at some point.

Dependencies:
Spdlog - for logging and console debugging output.

ImGui - for the debugging GUI.

Cereal - for emulator save stating.
