Controls for now are the arrow keys, z, x, enter, and right shift for select. Rebinding and controller support I would like to add at some point.

### Dependencies:

[Spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) - for logging and console debugging output.

[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - for the debugging GUI.

[Cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) - for emulator save stating.
